# shellcheck shell=bash
# Starts a nixkeeper instance's runs through GitHub's API (workflow
# dispatch), from a machine that's always on: GitHub's own schedule is
# best-effort and skips runs when it's busy (nixkeeper-hydra's hourly digest
# ran 3 times on 2026-10-06). Run it hourly at :15 UTC (the nix-darwin agent
# and NixOS timer in docs/all-packages.md); by the hour in UTC it starts:
#
#   every hour      the hourly updates of NIXKEEPER_START_REPO (default
#                   iedame/nixkeeper), except every 3 hours (00, 03, 06...)
#   every 3 hours   its sync instead, when due by the instance's interval
#                   (if_older "auto": every 3 hours on the community
#                   instance, daily on a fork; it checks update PRs too).
#                   Not both at once: they share the data branch's
#                   concurrency group, where only one run can wait and a
#                   newer one cancels it, so fewer runs queued means less
#                   chance of losing the sync
#
# and the digests in NIXKEEPER_START_DIGESTS' repositories (default iedame;
# empty for none: a fork reads iedame's digests, run by iedame):
#
#   every hour      nixkeeper-hydra's (stops early with no newer evaluation),
#                   nixkeeper-vulnerabilities' (a new repository's
#                   schedule ran once in its first 7 hours, 2026-10-08)
#                   and nixkeeper-prs' (its open PRs, and their diffs)
#   every 3 hours   nixkeeper-updates'
#   04 UTC          nixkeeper-versions', if its last run is over 12 hours old
#
# The workflows keep their own schedules as a fallback: a run started twice
# (by both) either waits for the other and finds nothing new, or stops at
# once (if_older).
#
# The token: a fine-grained one for those repositories with only "Actions:
# read and write" (it can start and cancel runs, nothing else), from the
# file NIXKEEPER_START_TOKEN_FILE, else systemd's credential "token"
# (LoadCredential), else the macOS Keychain item "nixkeeper-start-runs".
# --dry-run prints what it would start, without one.
#
# A start GitHub answers with a server error (5xx), or doesn't answer, is
# tried again after 1 minute and then 3 (NIXKEEPER_START_RETRY_WAITS, in
# seconds): on 2026-10-07 one hour's starts all got 500s, and a lost start
# of nixkeeper-updates' is 3 hours lost. Other answers (a bad token, a
# wrong workflow) aren't: they won't change by waiting. Should a failed
# start have started the run after all, the second is harmless (see above).
