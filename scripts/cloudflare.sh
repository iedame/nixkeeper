# Publishes the page with its data (page/ and data/, one site) to Cloudflare,
# as a Worker serving only static assets, for an instance served from there:
# the community one, at https://nixkeeper.com/. The page then finds its data
# next to it (data/), from Cloudflare's edge, instead of on
# raw.githubusercontent.com. Run by the data workflows
# (.github/workflows/data-*.yml) after they publish the data branch, which
# stays the syncs' own copy (they restore from it).
#
#   bash scripts/cloudflare.sh deploy [--force]
#
# Only when the page or the data changed since the last deploy (or --force):
# the site's version.json (the page's git tree, a hash of the data) is
# compared with the live one first, so a run that changed nothing deploys
# nothing, and a page change goes out with the next run of either workflow.
#
# Needs CLOUDFLARE_WORKER (the Worker's name; without it, this does nothing:
# an instance on GitHub Pages only), CLOUDFLARE_SITE_URL (where it's served,
# https://nixkeeper.com), CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID and CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN (a
# token with only Account → Workers Scripts → Edit). wrangler is nixpkgs'
# (this flake's lock), unless NIXKEEPER_WRANGLER names another command (for
# tests).
