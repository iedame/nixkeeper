# Community update checks: rules anyone can add by pull request, for any
# nixpkgs package, so every nixkeeper that opts in gets quicker, more precise
# new-release checks than Repology alone gives. Opt in with
#
#   community.updateChecks = true;
#
# in your package lists (package-lists/default.nix, or lists.community in the
# NixOS or nix-darwin module). Each sync then uses the rules here for
# the packages it tracks, and only those: nothing is fetched for the rest.
# Your own update checks win over these for the same package. The rules come
# with nixkeeper, so they change only when you update it.
#
# The format is your own update checks' (package-lists/update-checks.nix):
# keyed by the package's row name (its nixpkgs attribute), each one of
#
#   github = "owner/repo";  tags = "regex";           a repository's tags
#   github = "owner/repo";  branch = "name";          an unstable version's
#                                                     branch (+ outdatedAfter)
#   url = "https://...";    pattern = "regex";        a web page
#   follows = "package";                              updated together with
#                                                     that package (same
#                                                     version, same PRs)
#
# plus `frequent = true;` to also be checked by the hourly checks. Because
# these run on everyone's machines, they're held to limits your own rules
# aren't, and a rule beyond them is refused, never fetched:
#
#   - url: https only, to a public host by name: no IP addresses, no
#     localhost or local-network names, and redirects must stay public;
#     a page is read up to 2 MB;
#   - tags and pattern: at most 200 characters, with no repeated repeats
#     like (a+)+ and no back-references, which can take forever to match;
#   - only the fields above; follows takes no others, and fetches nothing
#     (it only uses that package's results, when you track both).
#
# A good rule follows what nixpkgs packages: the stable series it tracks, the
# page its source comes from. Explain that in the pull request that adds it
# (where the version comes from, and why this rule): the rules themselves
# stay a plain list, sorted by package (nix fmt keeps it so).
