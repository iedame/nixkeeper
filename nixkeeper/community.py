"""The community lists (community/): rules anyone can contribute by PR, for
any nixpkgs package, in the format of your own lists:

- update checks (update-checks.nix), where to look for new releases;
- ignored updates (ignored-updates.nix), failed nixpkgs-update attempts that
  don't count (a version that was never really released);
- up-to-date rules (up-to-date.nix), versions Repology gets wrong
  (nixkeeper/uptodate.py).

Each is opt-in in the package lists:

    community = { updateChecks = true; ignoredUpdates = true; upToDate = true; };

Then each sync uses the community's rules for the packages it tracks, your
own winning over the community's (for an update check or an up-to-date rule,
per package; for an ignore rule, per version). The rules come with nixkeeper
(the version you have pinned): new ones arrive when you update it, never in
between.

Community update checks run on every subscriber's machine, so they're held
to limits your own aren't (safety(), and http.get's safe mode): an unsafe one
is refused and reported, never fetched. Ignore and up-to-date rules fetch
nothing."""
