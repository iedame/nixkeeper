"""The PR check: for every outdated package, the update PR that's open (to
review) and the one merged into master (waiting for the channel), hourly, so
those badges don't wait for the sync. A merged PR shows "on master" as soon
as it's found, before Hydra has built it. Changes rarely: only when an update
PR opens, becomes ready or is merged. `nixkeeper pr-check`; from a checkout,
`nix run .#pr-check`.

From nixkeeper-prs' digest (prs_digest), made hourly: every outdated
package's update PRs in one download, no token, no search. Its lists are up
to an hour old, so the packages of the lists' maintainers (the "maintained"
list) are still searched for directly, for the freshest "on master"; the
other lists' and teams' (and, with every package, the rest of nixpkgs) only
through the digest, so those lists can grow without the searches growing.
Without a usable digest, as before: searched per package (with every
package, the lists' own only)."""
