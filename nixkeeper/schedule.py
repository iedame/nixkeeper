"""Asking less about what's quiet. Something with nothing going on (a Hydra
build that went fine, a package with no open PRs or issues) is asked about
every QUIET_DAYS instead of daily: once on its own slot day, by a hash of its
name, so every day has about the same share (as nixpkgs-update spreads its
queue), or once that long has passed, in case a sync was missed. Whatever
has something going on is asked daily (daily); each source decides what
that is (hydra.due, github.add_counts). Both count time, not syncs: a sync
run every few hours asks no more often than a daily one, and what changed
(a new package, a version moved, an edited rule) is asked at once."""
