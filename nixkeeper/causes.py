"""Why things fail, across packages: failed builds grouped by the same error
(the line of their log that says it, nixkeeper-hydra's excerpt, with what
differs from one package to the next taken out: store paths, file paths
and line numbers, numbers, quoted names), and the update bot's failures by
cause. A group is one cause with one fix pattern ("the abseil-cpp update
broke 7 packages"), which neither the blockers (those are failing, not
blocked) nor the reason filters (330 "compile") show. Automatic: a new
compiler or library breaking many packages the same way is a new group on
the next sync, under any reason, "other" included; a big one there is the
next reason for nixkeeper-hydra's classifier.

Groups get a friendly title where a pattern is known (TITLES), else the
error line itself, as read."""
