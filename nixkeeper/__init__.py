"""nixkeeper: a health dashboard for the nixpkgs packages you maintain: new
releases, build and update failures, and vulnerabilities, in one place.

`nixkeeper sync` (nixkeeper/sync.py) runs one sync: it works out which
packages to track from package-lists/, gathers what every source says about
them, and writes data/ for the page in page/. The frequent checks
(`nixkeeper frequent-check`, `nixkeeper pr-check`) refresh a few rows of the
last published data. nixkeeper/cli.py is the command. CONTRIBUTING.md maps the modules.
