"""nixkeeper-vulnerabilities' digest (https://github.com/iedame/nixkeeper-
vulnerabilities): what the NixOS security tracker and OSV say about nixpkgs
packages, in one download, read by the daily sync.

Each row gets "vulnerabilities": its CVEs (the tracker's) and advisories
(OSV's), each with a verdict:

- the tracker's issue says "not affected" or "not for us": "dismissed";
  "won't fix": "wontFix" (counted);
- else nixVersion against the CVE record's affected ranges, as nixkeeper
  orders versions: "affected" (counted) in one, "fixed" outside them all.
  The tracker's own status is that same check, but on the version a
  branch had when it last evaluated it, often long ago (2026-10-08: 487
  of its 873 "affected on master" already fixed in nixpkgs): it's used
  only when a range can't be read, "tracker" (counted) when it said
  affected, "fixed" unaffected, "unconfirmed" otherwise;
- OSV's advisories, "osv" (counted), but not for a CVE the tracker has;
- and a counted one nixpkgs patches (a patch named after the CVE, on the
  channel's commit): "patched", not counted (2026-10-08: 28 packages).

A row is vulnerable (changes.is_vulnerable) when one is counted, nixpkgs
marks it insecure, or Repology flags it: the tracker's entries cover some
of a package's CVEs, not necessarily those Repology flags it for, so its
flag stays a source of its own. Without a usable digest, Repology's flag
and nixpkgs' mark decide, as before."""
