"""The Emacs package archives' newest versions, from nixkeeper-versions'
emacs.json.gz (feeds.py): what nixpkgs' emacsPackages are made from, which
Repology mostly can't compare (MELPA's versions are dates: "untrusted").

nixpkgs lays the archives over each other, a later one winning (pkgs/top-
level/emacs-packages.nix): GNU ELPA, NonGNU ELPA, MELPA Stable, MELPA, then
its hand-written packages. So a row of emacsPackages (apply) is compared
with:
  1. MELPA, when its version is MELPA's, a build's date and time
     (20251005.508);
  2. else the first of MELPA Stable, NonGNU ELPA and GNU ELPA that has the
     package, in nixpkgs' order;
  3. none (Repology's verdict stays) for the hand-written packages
     (manual-packages), the devel archives' versions (0.0.20260424.102016)
     and packages no archive has."""
