"""GitHub releases from nixkeeper-versions' digest (its releases.json.gz):
for every nixpkgs package fetched from a GitHub tag, the newest version
among its repository's tags matching its tag scheme, and its latest
release's, as the update check worked out from its source would find them
(the digest runs nixkeeper's own inferred.github_check), read from GitHub
in bulk instead of a request per package.

Each becomes the row's worked-out check result ("upstream", inferred), so
it adds a newer version Repology hasn't seen and never takes Repology's
verdict away (upstream.apply): measured on 2026-10-09, GitHub and Repology
agree on 86% of 23,009 packages; where only Repology says outdated, a
project moved and its old repository stopped as often as Repology matched
another project (docs/design/github-releases.md in nixkeeper's notes).

Not for a package with a rule of its own or the community's (rules win),
nor Coq and Rocq libraries (SKIPPED_SETS), nor where it can't be
trusted: the version its tag scheme was worked out from isn't the
channel's (bumped since the digest's weekly evaluation: a
new tag scheme is possible), or its pick is older than nixpkgs' version
(the scheme matches another series). A package on the lists the digest
read over LISTS_MAX_DAYS ago, or can't answer, gets the sync's own
worked-out check instead, as before."""
