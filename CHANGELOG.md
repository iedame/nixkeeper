# Changelog

Notable changes to nixkeeper. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (before 1.0, a minor bump means new
features).

The version lives in `pyproject.toml`; `flake.nix` reads it from there.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Platforms where nixpkgs marks a package broken (`meta.broken`, evaluated per
  platform at the channel's commit, since the package index only reflects
  x86_64-linux). They show as "marked broken" (amber) with a link to the
  package source, don't count as failed, and are listed in the status issue
  without notifying.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- Build failures from Hydra (jobset `nixpkgs/unstable`, i.e. master) for each
  tracked package on x86_64-linux, aarch64-linux and aarch64-darwin, limited to
  the platforms it declares. Unfree packages, which Hydra doesn't build, are
  skipped.
- Build panel on the page: clicking a row's build cell shows each platform's
  result, with links to the build or its log and when a failing job last built
  successfully. It shares the space under the row with the package details.
- Status issue: one issue in this repository, rewritten on every sync, listing
  what's failed, outdated, flagged vulnerable or not refreshed. A comment (which
  is what notifies) is posted when something newly needs attention, including a
  package starting to fail on another platform; good news is only listed.
- Links to where nixpkgs defines each package, at the channel's exact commit
  and line.
- Workflow warnings when GitHub search counts look wrong (failed searches, or
  every PR count equal to its issue count).
- `nix flake check` validates the package lists (unknown attributes or
  maintainer handles, aliases such as `python3Packages`, duplicates) and runs
  formatting and lint checks (nixfmt, ruff, biome, deadnix, statix,
  actionlint). `nix fmt` formats everything.
- This changelog.

### Changed

- The page is split into `index.html`, `app.js` and `style.css`.
- The "failed" filter follows the platform filter: with macOS selected, a
  failure only on Linux doesn't count.
- A Repology domain that answers is tried first for the rest of the run, so an
  unreachable repology.org costs one failed connection instead of one per
  lookup.
- Workflows use `actions/checkout@v7`.
- The flake takes its version from `pyproject.toml`.

### Fixed

- PR counts in CI came back equal to issue counts: the sync workflow now has
  `pull-requests: read`.
- actionlint found no workflows in the Nix check (no `.git` there); they're
  passed explicitly.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-28

First versioned release, covering everything from the start of the project up
to its restructuring into a Python package.

### Added

- Daily sync (GitHub Actions) that compares tracked nixpkgs-unstable packages
  with Repology and publishes the results to the `data` branch.
- Static page (GitHub Pages) reading that data:
  - clickable counts for tracked, outdated, failed and flagged-vulnerable
    packages, following Repology's wording;
  - separate rows for stable and devel variants (wesnoth / wesnoth-devel),
    with a shaded "devel" badge;
  - how long each package has been outdated;
  - platform tags (Linux, macOS) that filter the list;
  - open nixpkgs PR and issue counts, from title-only GitHub searches by
    attribute name;
  - sorting by what needs attention (failed, then longest outdated) or A–Z;
  - filters, search and sort kept in the address;
  - a warning when the data is more than two days old;
  - placeholder columns for build and update failures.
- Package lists in `package-lists/`: every package maintained by the listed
  GitHub handles, plus extra packages by attribute (nested sets such as
  `haskellPackages.foo` included) or pname.
- Package metadata (maintainers, platforms, homepage) from the nixos-unstable
  channel's package index, without evaluating nixpkgs.
- Repology lookups by nixpkgs attribute, falling back to the project name.
- Retries, a fallback Repology domain, and reuse of the previous run's data
  (marked "not refreshed") when a lookup fails; the run aborts if most fail.
- GitHub searches batched through GraphQL.
- Unit tests, run on every build and in CI.
- `nix run .#sync` (alias `.#fetch`).

### Changed

- The data directory is rebuilt on every run and swapped in at the end, so
  packages removed from the lists don't leave files behind.
- The sync script is a Python package (`nixkeeper/`) with tests in `tests/`.
